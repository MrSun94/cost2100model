The updated version 2.3.5 is implemented by Meifang Zhu, Lund University, Sweden.
The get_H and get_dipole_G have been updated

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
The updated version 2.3.4 is implemented by Meifang Zhu, Lund University, Sweden.
The update_chan has been updated

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
The updated version 2.3.3 is implemented by Meifang Zhu, Lund University, Sweden.
Two scenarios are implemented so far
SemiUrban_300MHz: both NLOS and LOS single link MIMO simulations 
are supported. For outdoor LOS multiple link MIMO simulation is supported as well. 
IndoorHall_5GHz: OLOS single link MIMO simulation is supported.

The script "demo_model.m" provides an example for testing the COST 2100 model. It selects scenario, link type, and initiates the simulation.
The output of demo_model.m is channel functions, with size dependent on the parameter choice and setup: 

1) SISO_omni: Transfer function for SISO omni-directional antenna
create_IR_omni: users have to set up the frequency separation, delta_f
 
2) MIMO_omni: Transfer function for MIMO omini-directional antenna
 create_IR_omni_MIMO: users have to set up the frequency separation, delta_f.
 Only 2 by 2 MIMO system is implemented.
 
3) MIMO_dipole: Transfer function for a theoretical antenna response for 
 any size of lambda/2-spaced linear dipole antenna arrays. An Ntx-by-Nrx theoretical 
 antenna array response is generated and the correponding 
 channel transfer function is simulated.
 
4) MIMO_measured: Transfer function for any measured MIMO antenna response
 get_H: users have to provide the full antenna response at the BS and 
 MS sides, and also the rotation of the antenna arrays. The antenna 
 response mat file have to be the same format as 'antSample.mat' file.


The modifications are listed in document changelog.
